============================
INSTRUCTIONS:
￼￼￼￼'Slice' the page PIXEL PERFECT in HTML5/CSS3. Make it responsive as much as possible. The navigation at the top and on the left are not part of the assignment (although you can always show us what you can do!).
Not all parts have to be working functionally. Below you will find a corresponding description per number (see the white numbers in the red dots).
1. The advanced filter starts with 1 row in which you can choose a certain filter. Only if you choose a filter from the first drop down the 2nd field becomes active.
2. First drop down: choose registration date and usergroup. Second dropdown if there is a registration date chosen: dropdown with before, after and on. Third drop down: calendar to pick a date.
3. Click on add row, a new row appears (same as the first row). First drop down: choose between before, after and on. Second dropdown: if there is a usergroup chosen: Multi select drop down in which you can pick 1 or more options + two links at the top with which you can select all fields or deselect them.
4. PLEASE NOTE: the red cross appears whenever you have selected all fields in a row. By pressing the red cross the row is deleted again.
5. Checkboxes: static
6. Update button: static
7. Cancel link: static
8. For each selected filter (row) a tag button is created. When you click the tag button,
the row is deleted. When you click on 'clear selection' all filters are removed all at
once.
9. Slice the page and table. Make sure that when you select a row, the color of that row
changes. The username and the 'window (9)' icon are href's.
10. These dropdowns appear as soon as you select a row from the table and disappear
when you have none selected.
